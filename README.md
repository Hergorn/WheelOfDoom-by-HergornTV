Wheel of Doom is a software that lets you set a timer after which a new challenge is selected on a visual Lucky Wheel.

The timer then resets.




In the Software you can set:

- the timer in seconds
- chellanges divided by a [,]
  
    example: Task1,Task2,Task3
- save, export and import those settings to a XML file.



the Wheel itself is a local html file, which you can point to inside your OBS or other broadcasting software
